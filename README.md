## üîç Overview

This study introduces a diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification using reconstruction-based anomaly detection.  The model is trained solely on clean ECG signals, learning to reconstruct clean representations from potentially noisy inputs. **Reconstruction errors, measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), serve as a proxy for noise levels** without requiring explicit noise labels during inference.

To address label inconsistencies and improve generalizability, we adopt a **distributional evaluation** strategy using the **Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$)**.  
By comparing the reconstruction error distributions of clean and noise-labeled ECGs, the model can:
- Identify optimal architectures and sampling configurations
- Detect mislabeled samples
- Refine the training dataset through low-error selection

Our final model achieves robust noise quantification with only **three reverse diffusion steps**, enabling efficient and scalable deployment in real-world settings.
